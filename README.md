Assigned option #5

> "A product ratings system. Anonymous users should be able to see a composite ratings as well as view
individual ratings and comments for each product. Only authenticated customers should be able to leave
a rating/review and only if they have purchased the product in question. Make sure the ratings are visual
(for example Font-Awesome). You will need to modify the database schema to do this. Use AJAX for
assigning ratings."

This repository will stay in the version that it was submitted (only code-wise, this README.md commit is being added after submission). Any further changes will be made by the individual as part of their own fork and do not count toward the assigned project.
